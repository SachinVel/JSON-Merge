This project needs json-simple-1.1.jar

Function explanation:
	The function traverses through each objects of Json Arrray in input files and put the same objects in the result array.
	For different result array the size is reduced based on MAX_SIZE given in input and is written to output file.

Time Complexity : 
	suppose m is number of resultArray and n is number of objects in each result array.
	Then worst case time complexity is O(mn).
